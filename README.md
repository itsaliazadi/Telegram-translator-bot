# Telegram-translator-bot
One of the benefits of this short project was helping me learn more about the **python-telegram-bot** which is an awesome library for the python developers who are interested in making **telegram bots**.</br>
What this bot does is pretty straightforward.It recieves a text and a language from you and translates the text into that language.</br>
For the translation part, I decided to use the **GoogleTranslator** that is an incredible translating machine.</br>
But the more challenging part was making the bot itsself which was done with the help of **python-telegram-bot** library and I could learn a lot about this library throughout this project.</br>
You can use the **requirements.txt** file in case you want to be informed of the packages used in this project.
